## What I Do

Guidance for Isabelle formalizations and proof development using the PIDE MCP server.

## When To Use Me

Use this skill when working with Isabelle theory files (*.thy) or ML files (*.ML) via the PIDE MCP.

## Quick Reference

PIDE MCP comes with a customizable set of tools. 
This SKILL file describes some basic tools that might be available.
Also load other SKILL files that describe tools offered by PIDE MCP.
Operational rules (further elaborated in the sections below):

- **After every edit, call `get_state`** to see status, errors, warnings.
- **Restrict by `start_line` / `end_line`** when querying to avoid analysing data for hundreds of finished commands in large theories.
- **`sorry` is reported as `bad`, not as an `error`.** A clean theory has 0 bad commands AND 0 errors AND 0 failures.
- **If `> 0` commands are running for more than ~30s, suspect a loop** - restructure rather than wait.
- **Use `get_progress` whenever you think the process is stuck** - it shows progress of theories and lists currently running commands.
- **Use `get_progress` for a global overview and `get_state` for theory-local information.**
- **The PIDE perspective** is set by some tools and marks the commands for which print functions are run, which return extra output e.g. automatic `quickcheck` and `solve_direct` information.
- **`create_scratch`**: use for exploration and alternatives. (Typically) use the same imports on scratch theories as the ones you use for the development that you are creating a scratch theory for.

## Interaction with Isabelle via PIDE MCP

### State Synchronization
- **All changes are immediately checked** by PIDE after edits.
- **Do not edit files via other means** (shell, other editors) - always use MCP tools to keep PIDE state synchronized. Reading via other tools (e.g. grep) for unloaded theories for exploration (e.g. grepping the AFP) is OK.
- **If you experience discrepancies between the PIDE state and the file's disk content, use read on the affected file to re-synchronise the content.** Such discrepancies might happen, for example, when a human user is working on the same file as you or when you didn't edit a file via PIDE but with primitive file operations.
- **Avoid absolute file path imports for theories. Use session-qualified theory names for sessions available to you.** See `list_session_directories` on how to find session qualifiers.
- When you are told to synchronise, just re-read the file.
- **Edits require `old_text` (the text to be searched for in the target range). If the file changed since you last read it (e.g., a human edited it concurrently), old_text might not be found and the edit be rejected. Re-synchronise in this case.**

### After Every Edit
1. **Check for errors/unfinished/successful commands after edits with `get_state`**.
2. **`sorry`s are included as `bad` commands. `errors` counts actual failures. A "clean" state requires both to be 0.**

### Time Management
- **Avoid adding large amounts of new material at once, as it makes it hard to identify the source of errors and nontermination.**
- **Proof methods typically terminate in less than 5 seconds.**
- If commands take longer, be suspicious! Only if you are very confident that a proof legitimately needs more time wait a bit longer. Short waits typically let you move faster!
- **If `get_state` shows `> 0` running commands for more than ~30 seconds, suspect non-termination** (a loop or overly expensive computation). Restructure rather than wait.
- **Use `get_progress` to show the progress and currently running commands across all theories.** 

### Scratch Theories
- **Use `create_scratch` to test large changes in a scratch theory before radically changing an existing theory.**
- **Scratch theories persist for the session** - they are not deleted until the server stops. You may further change and explore them once created.
- Use the scratch theories to try proofs and search tools without polluting your main development. Exception: if it is just a brief exploration (e.g. calling `sledgehammer` or `find_theorems` on the currently open goals), just do it in the same theory.
- For scratch theories, pass the imports matching your needs. Typically, it is the same imports as the ones you use for the development that you are creating a scratch theory for.

**Incremental workflow** (for developing complex proofs):
```
1. create_scratch → scratch theory_path

2. edit → extend the scratch theory (insert new content)

3. get_state → check the new status in the scratch theory

4. happy with the result → write it back to the original file
```

This allows you to test proof strategies and alternative developments without changing the original file.
Final results can be written back to the original file.

### Querying (Proof) Context
- **`get_state` returns structured information at any command position, including status (check it after edits), subgoals, all prover messages (errors, warnings, writelns, .etc), type information for terms,...**
- **`get_state` accepts flags to opt into richer data**, like `include_types` (for Isabelle and ML), `include_facts` (theorems used in range), etc.
- **Restrict by `start_line` / `end_line`** when you only care about a specific lemma or error - it is less verbose than scanning the whole file. But don't forget that local changes may have global effects.
- **`find_entities` lets you explore defined entities (theorems, definitions, methods, ML terms, etc.)**.
Moreover, you can use Isar commands if necessary, for example:
- **`print_facts` - print all facts of the current context (named assumptions, case facts, intermediate results, locale assumptions, etc.)**
- `find_theorems`
- `find_consts`

### Importing existing library, facts, and definitions
- **Use `list_session_directories` to get all available session directories, often containing useful library material.**
- Import theories from these sessions using the right **session-qualified import**.
- **To get session qualifiers, grep the ROOT files in the session directories.**

### Common Pitfalls

#### Large Changes
- ❌ **Don't:** Add hundreds of lines of new definitions and proofs in one edit
- ✅ **Do:** Add incrementally - a few definitions at a time, check after each
  - Easier to identify source of errors
  - Faster feedback on timeouts
  - Better isolation of problematic proofs

#### Status Checking
- ❌ **Don't:** Make multiple edits without checking status
  ```
  edit  (* Add lemma 1 *)
  edit  (* Add lemma 2 *)
  edit  (* Add lemma 3 - which one has the error? *)
  ```
- ✅ **Do:** Check `get_state` after each significant edit
  ```
  edit
  get_state  (* Verify status: ok *)
  edit  (* Continue only after verification *)
  ```

#### Scratch Theory Usage
- ❌ **Don't:** Try to import scratch theories from your main development
- ✅ **Do:** Use scratch theories for experimentation, then copy successful results back to main theory
  ```
  1. create_scratch to test approach
  2. Verify it works in scratch theory
  3. Copy successful proof back to main theory with edit
  ```

### Error Recovery

If you encounter errors or non-termination:
1. Check the exact error.
2. Isolate the problem: use `sorry` to skip problematic parts temporarily.
3. Make incremental fixes: make small changes and check after each.
4. Use `create_scratch` for experimentation and alternatives.
5. Increase wait for termination if needed, but prefer refactoring over long waits!
6. If you think the process is unresponsive, use `get_progress`.
