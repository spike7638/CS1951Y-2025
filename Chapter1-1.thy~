This text is a formalization of Robin Hartshorne's \emph{Foundations of Projective Geometry}
using the Isabelle proof assistant, primarily relying on Isar. Quotations 
from Hartshorne appear indented, with a blue line to the left. Additional material 
written by either the professor (John (Spike) Hughes) or various students are surrounded by colored 
markers, like this:

with the black marker indicating the end of the section written by Spike (except that in this case, 
it's part of a larger section Spike wrote). 
git@github.com:spike7638/CS1951Y-2025.git
Within Isabelle, numbered propositions or theorems from Hartshorne are given names that tie back 
to the text, so Proposition 1.1 in the text is called \texttt{Prop1P1}, with ``P'' replacing the period, 
for instance. 

We've based our theory on "Complex\_Main" instead of main so that we have the datatype "real". To 
characterize affine and projective planes (the main topics of study) we use ``locales'', an Isabelle 
construct that lets us say ``this entity satisfies this collection of defining axioms.''

This "starter file" is about 1400 lines long, and reflects a modest part of Chapter 1 of 
Hartshorne's book. That's partly because I've added some commentary, and partly because I've often 
used the more verbose fixes-assumes-shows way of stating theorem, and partly because a single throwaway
sentence in the text, like "it's easy to see that the usual coordinate plane satisfies the axioms 
of an affine plane" can turn into a great many lines of proving here; even asserting the truth 
of the implicit claims can take a page, and proofs are often longer.

If something I've written seems duplicated, out of order, unnecessary -- go ahead and delete it.
In subsequent chapters, the process of translating statements in Hartshorne into lemmas/theorems
in this formalization will fall more and more to students rather than to me.

\begin{hartshorne}
Projective geometry is concerned with properties of incidence --- properties which are 
invariant under stretching, translation, or rotation of the plane. Thus in the axiomatic 
development of the theory, the notions of distance and angle will play no part.
However, one of the most important examples of the theory is the real projective plane,
and there we will use all the techniques available (e.g. those of Euclidean geometry and analytic 
geometry) to see what is true and what is not true.

\begin{hartshorne}
Let us start with some of the most elementary facts of ordinary plane geometry, which we will
take as axioms for our synthetic development.

Definition. An \emph{affine plane} is a set, whose elements are called points, and a set of
subsets, called \emph{lines}, satisfying the following three axioms, A1â€“A3. We will use the
terminology ``$P$ lies on $l$'' or ``$l$ passes through $P$'' to mean the point $P$ is an 
element of the line $l.$
\begin{itemize}
\item{A1.}
Given two distinct points $P$ and $Q$, there is one and only one line containing both $P$ and $Q.$
We say that two lines are parallel if they are equal or if they have no points in common.\\
\item{A2.}
Given a line $l$ and a point $P$ not on $l,$ there is one and only one line 
$m$ which is parallel to $l$ and which passes through $P.$\\

\item{A3.} There exist three non-collinear points. (A set of points $P_1, \ldots, P_n$ is said to be 
\emph{collinear} if there exists a line $l$ containing them all.)
\end{itemize}

Notation: 
\begin{align}
P \ne Q && \text{$P$ is not equal to $Q$.} \\
P \in l && \text{$P$ lies on $l$.}\\
l \cap m && \text{the intersection of $l$ and $m$.}\\
l \parallel m && \text{$l$ is parallel to  $m$.}\\
\forall && \text{for all.}\\
\exists && \text{there exists.}\\
\implies && \text{implies.}
\iff && \text{if and only if.}
\end{align}

To translate to Isabelle, we are saying that to have an affine plane, you need two types (one for points, 
one for lines), and a set, which we'll call `Points', of items of the first type, and a set, which we'll call 
`Lines', of the second type. 

In a first attempt to formalize this text, I actually chose to use a \emph{type} for points and lines, but that rapidly becomes
inconvenient. Unfortunately, in Isabelle functions are defined on domains that must be types, 
not sets. Fortunately, they need not be fully specified:  $F(a)$ may be 'undefined' for
 some element $a$ of the domain of $F$, which effectively limits the domain of $F$ to those 
items in its domain type for which we \emph{have} provided a description of the associated value. 

To complete the definition of an affine plane, you not only need types for points and lines, you 
need a relationship between them. The statement "incid P l" indicates the notion
that the "point" P lies on (or is "incident on") the "line" l. For Hartshorne, we would say P 
is an element of l, but using
point sets as lines turns out to be a horrible idea in Isabelle, so we just deal with "incid".

Furthermore, if you look closely at the first axiom, it's saying that there's a function that takes two distinct 
points and returns the (unique) line joining them, so we'll also use a function called "join P Q" to represent that. 

Similarly, A2 implicitly describes another function that takes a line and a point and returns a line,
 one that we'll call ``find parallel''. The three functions --- incid, join, find_parallel --- encode the 
essence of an affine plane. 

Sadly, the notion of "parallel" makes sense only after we have our sets of Points and Lines, and a "incid" function, 
so if we want to define parallel, it has to happen after we describe the affine plane. But without a definition of
parallel, the statements of the axioms become very messy, since they essentially have to replace "parallel" with 
the not-yet-written definition. We address this by first creating a locale called "affine_plane_data", in which 
we specify the data needed to define an affine plane, and can then define things like parallel and collinear, 
and then we define a further locale, \isi{affine_plane}, which is an \isi{affine_plane_data} together with some
extra rules (the axioms).

In what follows, "p" and "l" are the types used for points and lines, and Points and Lines are the particular subsets 
of the types p and l, the ones that constitute our geometry. These are named in the locale "affine_plane_data", which is then 
used within the locale "affine_plane". This allows us to define "parallel" strictly in terms of "incid", so that the
term "parallel" can be used in the description of the locale affine_plane. While we're defining those 
things, we also prove some small facts about them that we'll use later. We could have put these proofs
in \isi{affine_plane}, but it's nice to have them near the introduction of these functions.

Notice that if we apply "parallel" to two equal items of type \isi{'l} that happen to not be lines, 
it returns \isi{False}. That means that \isi{parallel} is not a reflexive relation on universal set of type 
\isi{'l}. If we consider it only on the smaller set \isi{Lines}, then it \emph{is} in fact a reflexive
relation.

This \isi{infix} clause says that from now on we 
can write \isi{n || k} and it will be immediately converted internally to \isi{parallel n k}, and 
that when it comes time for Isabelle to output something represented as 
\isi{parallel a b}, it'll be written \isi{a || b}. (A similar statement holds for "\<lhd>".)
Note that \isi{a} and \isi{b} can be complex expressions here rather than just single names; Isabelle 
recognizes and parses them correctly.

It's worth looking at this collection pretty carefully. Do the required properties of \isi{join} in
\isi{a1a} and \isi{a1b} make sense? Do they properly represent Hartshorne's axiom A1? What about the 
other encodings of axioms? And what is \isi{m1} telling us? 

A locale-description like this is followed by a begin-end block (the isi{begin} is included above)
 within which all the things mentioned
in the locale-description are available for use, so you can refer to \isi{parallel} or \isi{Points} 
freely. You can also prove small theorems, which will then be usable whenever they're applied to 
something that is an instance of an \isi{affine_plane}.\<close>

\begin{hartshorne}
Example. The ordinary plane, known to us from Euclidean geometry, satisfies the axioms A1â€“A3, and 
therefore is an affine plane. [NB: We'll return to this, and a second example, below. -- jfh]

A convenient way of representing this plane is by introducing Cartesian coordinates, 
as in analytic geometry. Thus a point $P$ is represented as a pair $(x, y)$ of real numbers. 
(We write $x, y \in \Bbb R$.)

[Omitted picture]
\prop[1.1] Parallelism is an equivalence relation.

\begin{hartshorne}
\defn[equivalence relation] A relation $\sim$ is an equivalence relation if it has the following
three properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Reflexive: $a \sim a$
\item Symmetric: $a \sim b \implies b \sim a$
\item Transitive: $a \sim b$ and $b \sim c \implies a \sim c$.
\end{enumerate}

\proof (of proposition)
We must check the three properties:
1. Any line is parallel to itself, by definition. 

2. $l \parallel m \implies m \parallel l$ by definition.

3. If $l \parallel m$, and $m \parallel n$, we wish to prove $l \parallel n.$

If $l=n$ ,there is nothing to prove.If $l \ne n$,and there is a point
$P \in l \cap n$,then $l, n$ are both $\parallel m$ and pass through $P$, which is impossible by 
axiom A2. We conclude that $l \cap n = \emptyset$ (the empty set), and so $l \parallel n.$

Example. An affine plane has at least four points. There is an affine plane with four points.

Indeed, by A3 there are three non-collinear points. Call them $P, Q, R.$ By A2 there is a line 
$l$ through $P,$ parallel to the line $QR$ joining $Q$ and $R,$ which exists by A1. 
Similarly, there is a line $m \parallel  PQ$, passing through $R.$

Now $l$ is not parallel to $m$ ($l \nparallel m$). For if it were, then we would have 
$PQ \parallel m \parallel l \parallel QR$
and hence $PQ \parallel QR$ by Proposition 1.1. This is impossible, however, because $P Q \ne QR$, 
and both contain $Q.$

Hence $l$ must meet $m$ in some point $S.$ Since $S$ lies on $m,$ which is parallel to $PQ$, and 
different from $PQ,$ $S$ does not lie on $PQ,$ so $S\ne P$,and $S \ne Q$.Similarly $S \ne R$. Thus
$S$ is indeed a fourth point. This proves the first assertion.

Now consider the lines $PR$ and $QS$. It
may happen that they meet (for example in the real projective plane they will (proof?)). 
On the other hand, it is consistent with the axioms to assume that they do not meet.
In that case we have an affine plane consisting of four points $P, Q, R, S$ and six lines 
$PQ, PR, PS, QR, QS, RS,$ and one can verify easily that the axioms A1â€“A3 are satisfied. 
This is the smallest affine plane. [NB: We'll return to this final claim presently.]

text\<open>\spike In fact, not only have we shown that there are four points, we can show
that there are four points, no three of which are collinear. The proofs of these will appear
shortly.\<close>

text \<open>The proof of the following small theorem --- that every line k contains at least two points ---
really uses everything we know about an affine plane. We start by assuming k contains
just one point, S (zero is out because of the \isi{contained_point} theorem.The four-points-no-three-collinear
theorem tells us that distinct from S, we have a triple of points UVW that are noncollinear. 

find_parallel UV S = k
find_parallel VW S = k
That makes UV and VW parallel; because they both contain V, they're equal. That means that UV contains 
U, V, and W, so they're collinear -- a contradiction. 

Here's the theorem:

text \<open> Hartshorne mentioned, just after the definition of an affine plane and some notational
remarks, that the ordinary affine plane $A2$ is an example of an affine plane, as is the 4-point
affine plane $A4$. For $A2$, we should prove 
that it IS actually an affine plane. It's pretty clear how to represent points --- pairs of real 
numbers --- but what about lines? A line is the set of points satisfying an equation of 
the form Ax + By + C = 0, with not both of A and B being zero. The problem is that there's 
no datatype for ``pair of real numbers, at least one of which is nonzero''. We'll have 
to hack this by breaking lines into ``ordinary'' and ``vertical'', alas.  The construction
and proofs for these two examples is in Chapter1a.thy. Much of the work here 
on the first draft, with a rather different formulation of the locale, was done by Seiji and Caleb,with Jackson 
also contributing. \<close>

(* Some HW Problems to give you practice with Isabelle:
Try to state and prove these:
1. Every line contains at least two points (this is stated for you below, but
with "sorry" as a "proof". 
2. Every line contains at least three points [false!]
*)

text\<open>To prove that every line contains at least two points, firstly we should think about where the
contradiction is when the line contains only one point. Usually, contradiction happens when something
violates a unique existence. For example, in A2, if an assumption leads to the conclusion that there
are more lines that could parallel to a specific line passing through the same point, then the assumption
is proved to be false. Here are the ideas for our proof.

i. If l only contains one point Q and point P != point Q, then every line passing through P is parallel
to l.
ii. To prove the contradiction to A2, we have to prove there are at least two lines passing through P. 
NB: need lemma contained-lines: for every point, there are at least two lines that pass through that point.
iii.Lemma contained-lines can be proved with the three non-collinear points P Q R in A3. Two cases:
1. The point is P or Q or R. (you need to figure out how to proceed from here) 
2. The point T is different from those 3 points. Then PT, QT, RT cannot
be the same line, which proves that at least two lines pass through T.

We now try to prove that every affine plane contains at least four points. Sledgehammer 
(a generally-useful approach) doesn't get anywhere with this one. 

Here's Hartshorne's proof, though, so we can use the pieces to construct an Isabelle proof.

i. by A3 there are three distinct non-collinear points; call them P,Q,R. 
ii. By A1, there's a line, which I'll call QR, through Q and R. 
iii. By A2, there's a line l through P, parallel to QR.
iv. Similarly, there's a line PQ containing P and Q. 
v. There's a line m through R, parallel to the line PQ.

CASES: l is parallel to m, or it is not.  

vi. l is not parallel to m, for if it were, then PQ || m || l || QR, hence PQ || QR (by 
the lemmas about parallelism) and since both contain Q,  they are identical, but then P,Q,R are collinear,
which is a contradiction. 

vii. So l and m are nonparallel, and they share some point S. 

viii. S lies on m, which is parallel to PQ but not equal to it,
hence disjoint from it (see definition of parallel), so S is not on PQ.

ix.  Hence S != P, S != Q. 

x. Similar (arguing about l), we get  S != R. 

xi. Hence the four points P,Q,R,S are all distinct, and we are done.

The idea of one possible proof is this: : we have 4 distinct lines, in two parallel pairs H and K. But each line from 
H intersects each line from K. 
We already know l cannot be empty. 

If l = {X}, i.e., if l contains only a single point, then that special point X lies on at most one 
line in each of H and K. 

Select the (or an) other line in each set, and call them k and n. 

Then find_parallel k X = l and same for n X. (Why?)

That makes both k and n parallel to l, so parallel to each other. But they intersect and are 
distinct. Contradiction.

but that would require proving the existence of l (which we just did in the previous lemma) and
then proving that it's unique. Instead, we can just say that if l and m both contain the 
distinct points P and Q, then l must equal m. From this, and the previous lemma, we can then 
conclude that axiom 1 is true (which we'll do in a final theorem). 

This is arguably the ugliest theorem in the bunch, because it involves four cases (one each for 
l and m being ordinary or vertical). Once again, we start by providing names for the constructor

Completion of an affine plane to a projective plane 

Small problem: we need a data type for the points of the projective plane, which consists of
     all points of the affine plane together with all ideal points (i.e., line pencils), and we 
     need another for the lines of the PP, which consists of all lines of the affine plane (extended 
     by their associated ideal point) and the line at infinity consisting of all ideal points. We'll
     return to this, but first we need axioms for a projective plane.

2020: The main problem is that we really, really need quotient types; with luck, Haoze and Daniel will 
soon have worked these out for us so that we can proceed. 

2025: Actually, now that we have carrier sets for points and lines, we don't need quotient types,
which is good because you cannot use \isi{quotient_type} within a locale, because the resulting type
ends up dependent on any \emph{values} used to define the local (in our case, things like \isi{incid}, 
and this requires a notion of so-called 'dependent types', which Isabelle/HOL does not support. (Shoutout
to Lean here: it's based on dependent types, so this particular bit would be much nicer in Lean.)

\section*{Ideal points and the projective plane}

We will now complete the affine plane by adding certain ``points at infinity'' and thus arrive at 
the notion of the projective plane.

Let $A$ be an affine plane. For each line $l \in A,$ we will denote by $[l]$ the pencil of lines 
parallel to $l,$ and we will call $[l]$ an ``ideal point,'' or ``point at infinity,'' in the 
direction of $l.$ We write $P^{*} = [l]$.

We define the completion $S$ of $A$ as follows. The points of $S$ are the points of $A,$ plus all 
the ideal points of $A.$ A line in $S$ is either

\begin{enumerate}
\item An ordinary line $l$ of $A,$ plus the ideal point $P^{*} = [l]$ of $l$, or 
\item the ``line at infinity,'' consisting of all the ideal points of $A.$
\end{enumerate}

We will see shortly that $S$ is a projective plane, in the sense of the following definition.

\defn[Projective Plane] A ``projective plane'' $S$ is a set, whose elements are called points, 
and a set of subsets, called lines, satisfying the following four axioms.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[P1] Two distinct points $P, Q$ of $S$ lie on one and only one line. 
\item[P2] Any two lines meet in at least one point.
\item[P3] There exist three non-collinear points.
\item[P4] Every line contains at least three points.
\end{enumerate}

Let's go ahead and make a locale description for a projective plane, as we did for an affine plane. 

There's no need for a \isi{find_parallel} function this time, but other things are fairly similar.

\prop[1.3] The completion $S$ of an affine plane $A,$ as described above, is a projective plane.

\proof. We must verify the four axioms P1â€“P4 of the definition. 
\done
\spike
We'll define the projectivization of the incid function for an affine plane, but to do so, we'll first
have to define a ('p, 'l) projective point and a ('p, 'l) projective line, which we'll call 'ppoint and 'pline,
to be the types of the "point" and "line" sets in the projectivization of an affine plane that uses 
types 'p and 'l for its points and lines. 
\done

       
P1. Let $P,Q  \in S$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $P,Q$  are ordinary points of $A,$ then $P$ and $Q$ lie on only one line of $A.$ They do not 
lie on the line at infinity of $S,$ hence they lie on only one line of $S.$

\item If $P$ is an ordinary point, and $Q = [l]$ is an ideal point, we can find by A2 a line $m$ 
such that $P \in m$ and $m \parallel l$,i.e. $m \in [l]$,so that $Q$  lies on the extension of $m$ 
to $S.$ This is clearly the only line of $S$ containing $P$ and $Q.$

\item If $P, Q$ are both ideal points, then they both lie on the line of $S$ containing them.
\end{enumerate}

P2. Let $l, m$ be lines. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item If they are both ordinary lines, and $l \nparallel m,$ then they meet
in a point of $A.$ If $l \parallel m,$ then the ideal point $P^{*} =[l]=[m]$ lies on both $l$ and
$ m$ in $S.$
\item If $l$ is an ordinary line, and $m$ is the line at infinity, then $P^{*} = [l]$ lies on 
both $l$ and $m.$
\end{enumerate}

P3. Follows immediately from A3. One must check only that if $P,Q,R$ are non-collinear in $A,$ then
 they are also non-collinear in $S.$ Indeed, the only new line is the line at infinity, 
which contains none of them.

P4. Indeed, by Problem 1, it follows that each line of $A$ contains at least two points. 
Hence, in $S$ it has also its point at infinity, so has at least three points. \endproof

Examples. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item By completing the real affine plane of Euclidean geometry, we obtain the real projective plane.
\item By completing the affine plane of $4$ points, we obtain a projective plane with $7$ points.
\item Another example of a projective plane can be constructed as follows: let $\Bbb R^3$ be 
ordinary Euclidean 3-space, and let $O$ be a point of $\Bbb R^3.$ Let $L$ be the set of lines 
through $O.$

We define a point of $L$ to be a line through $O$ in $\Bbb R^3.$ We define a line of $L$ to be 
the collection of lines through $O$ which all lie in some plane through $O.$
Then $L$ satisfies the axioms P1â€“P4 (left to the reader), and so it is a projective plane.
\end{enumerate}
\end{hartshorne}
\spike
We'll go ahead and formalize the notion of projective plane as we did earlier; we won't prove 
proposition 1.3 (in Isabelle) until we have a good tool for quotient types, but we'll proceed 
with the work on the 7-point plane, etc.
